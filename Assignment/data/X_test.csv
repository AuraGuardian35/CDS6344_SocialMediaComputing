would you say a delay is more likely thanks so much
i cheated on you and i am sorry i will never do it again has given my wife and i the worst start to a honeymoon ever
disappointed that you didnt honor my 100 credit given to me for your mistakes taking my business elsewhere out
the airline is embarrassing itself i get that bad weather is not your fault but your response to it could not have been worse
my flight has been delayed amp i cannot talk reach anyone in customer service because of high call volume
this link in your tweet goes to someones internal email gt probably one of your 3rd party it contracts
betsy is the besty gettin stuck at las might not be bad for most but i want home homewardbound betsy besty thankyou
how many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls
when will the flight resume i dons see it in the open schedule
can you check on he status of my exp membership card need the physical card to access some international lounges soon
found the tix security code not working tried a dozen times
of course but they were just as helpless as everyone else
i do not need to make any changes i reserved my seats when i bought my tickets and there was an error amp now there are no comp seats
no oscars on direct tv on this flight we were so looking forward to it we were devastated
why would i pay 200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that are not even worth 200
yes i will do just that as soon as i have a moment to gather my thoughts
too long for 140 characters
well i did miss it but gate agents had rebooked boarding pass waiting when i landed time for lunch amp a beverage easy cheesy
wi fi on 737 800 aircraft 3511 did not work entire ord dca flight this morning
tried to rebook online but it says that i have to pay 200 for difference in price please help
rarely ceases to amaze for the worse i hope this is the last time i have to fly with you
my flight was 952 leaving las vegas at 5 40pm arriving at chi mid at 11 00 pm
i sent a message it is very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found this is truly worst service ever fedup disastrous
on hold for 20 mins and then used the call back service only to have an agent call me and put me on hold forever anyone there
pleaseeee find my suitcase i want deoderant and a clean shirt for work tomorrow
i am hoping we do not miss our lax ito connection not looking forward to being stuck at lax overnight with our team again
is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night if not i am having to sleep at the airport again tonight
well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on
offering special fares to
any site gmail facebook etc
for your information the site app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights i had errors with almost 24 hrs after sellout flying
got duped w a connection on 1st flight sneaky now you will not give me a seat on an earlier flight w availability shameful
such a bummer but i understand it is a business deal thanks for answering me much less sad now
sat on a plane for 2 hrs on 2 15 then we finally took off

worst service ever denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times how hard is it to schedule a gate next time
so plot thickens we are on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate apparently under the weather in large numbers
we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
i recommend upgrading your ivr and using call back email and texting from a know caller
this is despicable i spoke to many diff people amp everyone is telling me something different i have a claim no i need my bag now
i would like to talk to a customer service agent about the service non service i received on my last flight a a week or so a go j
