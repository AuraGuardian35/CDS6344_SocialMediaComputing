thank you you guys
system failure again bad trend software projects are like flying an airplane theres no such thing as an emergency takeoff
wait times of 2 hours to talk with an exec plt agent what is going on

you took the miles out of my account and told me that i could restore by paying 150 or opening a credit card
i spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they cannot help need help with family pooling as soon as possible
it is 9 56 and the desk attendant stated we would sit awhile until given the all clear lack of communication seems to the norm
this always happens with you guys and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable is that good business to you
you should be more timely with bags that missed a flight people need their undies the next morning
why have airlines always told us they cannot open a cabin door once it has been closed this plane has done it 3 times tonight
i ve been on hold for 36 minutes now any time you want to answer the phone that would be great
i need to be at work tomorrow at 8am therefore that doesnt help direct message faster than calling 800 number backwards
thank you

how will i change it
yes however the seats they assign us that day are never together i just want to sit with my husband why is that impossible
